Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of compounds that researchers are increasingly interested in due to their practically unlimited potential for designing new structural phases and a wide range of functional properties. The structure of MOFs consists of two main components: metal oxide clusters and organic molecule ions (ligands or linkers) that form the framework of the MOF, containing voids of various sizes. The exploitation properties, such as hydrogen storage and transport, targeted drug delivery, catalytic and adsorptive properties, among others, depend on the composition and combination of these two components.

The composition (elemental composition, phase purity: whether it's a single-phase sample or not; crystallographic properties of components: size, formal charge, electronegativity, electronic structure) and structure (atomic structure: spatial group, cell parameters, interatomic distances, microstructure: specific surface area, particle size at all levels of organization, pore size, etc.) of MOFs are determined by the synthesis methods and conditions (precursor composition, process temperature and duration, hydrogen ion concentration (pH), etc.).

Understanding the fundamental triad of "composition-structure-properties" enables establishing connections between the composition and structure of MOFs with their exploitation characteristics. This allows for targeted synthesis of MOFs with specific properties for particular applications, especially in catalysis. However, solving this task is challenging using a "chemical" approach due to the multi-parameter factors involved: it requires sequentially changing synthetic process conditions over a wide range, determining the composition and structure for each sample, which necessitates a complex set of methods not always fully available to the technologist.

This is a lengthy, uneconomical, labor-intensive process. Only by utilizing information technology with all its capabilities can the path from compound synthesis to its properties be shortened, leading to material development.

The developed program enables finding optimal synthesis conditions of Fe-based MOFs to obtain samples that are:
- Single-phase,
- With necessary microstructural characteristics (crystallite size, specific surface area, pore size, particle size),
- With catalytic properties,
and specifies the pathways to achieve these parameters. All these characteristics depend on synthesis conditions and significantly influence exploitation properties (adsorptive, catalytic, etc.).

The goal of the work is to establish the role of synthesis conditions on the key characteristics of MIL-100(Fe).

The developed program code can be used as a basis for more in-depth feature analysis or testing on other datasets.
